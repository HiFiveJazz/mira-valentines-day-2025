      <h1>INFO</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Jasmeet/Jazz, a graduate from the University of California, San Diego, where I studied Bioengineering: Biosystems, graduating back in June of 2024. Thrust into the postgraduate life, I've turned my life into a soulful exploration of the many small things I enjoy! This website initially started out as personal photo gallery but has evolved into a space where I share the combination of my engineering skillset towards a creative outlet.</p>
      <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve immersed myself in scientific research, hoping that my work will someday positively impact lives. Along this path, I have loved learning new skills—whether it’s the delicate art of playing the piano or delving into the intricacies of a challenging language. Every new endeavor is a step that my curiosity and creativity propel me forward, affirming that growth is always within reach when we trust in the process. I hope that in sharing my life, I can inspire someone to keep pushing towards their own life goals.</p>
      <p>
          At the end of the day, I just enjoy improving lives, whether that takes the form of simple chats over coffee or tea, to medical device design. From early academic recognition to community leadership, each experience has deepened my empathy and resolve. Whether working as a Dental Assistant, running a social organization, or shadowing healthcare professionals, I've seen firsthand how genuine connection can transform us. These moments gently shape my vision and my character, resulting in me becoming a lot more compassionate and optimistic for what the future holds.
