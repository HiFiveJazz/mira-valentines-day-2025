      <h1>INFO</h1>
      <p>I am an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego, where I embraced the study of Bioengineering: Biosystems, culminating in my graduation in June 2024. This academic journey has been a soulful exploration of science intertwined with the desire to make a difference—a path filled with both structured learning and serendipitous discovery.</p>
      <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve immersed myself in scientific research with a gentle hope that my work will someday positively impact lives. Along this path, I have joyfully embraced learning new skills—whether it’s the delicate art of playing the piano or delving into the intricacies of a challenging language. Every new endeavor is a step that my curiosity and creativity propel me forward, affirming that growth is always within reach when we trust in the process.</p>
      <p>
          At the heart of everything I do is a profound commitment to improving lives. From early academic recognition to community leadership, each experience has deepened my empathy and resolve. Whether working as a Dental Assistant, running a social organization, or shadowing healthcare professionals, I've seen firsthand how genuine connection can transform us. These moments gently shape my vision—a balance of rigorous study and heartfelt outreach, guiding me toward a more compassionate and innovative future.
